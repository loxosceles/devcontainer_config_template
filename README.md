# Devcontainer Configuration Template

Build a development container for Javascript and Python based projects.

## How to use 

Configure your dotfile repository in a new `.env` file at the root of this
project if you want to use [Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) to automatically
pull your own dot files.

Also, don't forget to modify the `chezmoi.toml`.
